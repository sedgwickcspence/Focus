# Contributing to our project

Thanks for your help improving the FinOps Foundation FOCUS Converter project!

## Getting Help

If you have a question about this project or have encountered problems using it,
you can start by asking a question on [FinOps Foundation Slack](https://www.finops.org/membership/) in the [#chat-focus](https://finopsfoundation.slack.com/archives/C034GBRQGGY)

## Workflow

This repository's contribution workflow follows a typical open-source model:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository
- Work on the forked repository
- Open a pull request to [merge the fork back into this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Developer Certificate of Origin

This project requires a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org) on all Pull Requests.

By contributing to this project, you certify that your contribution was created in whole or in part by you and that you have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the project. In other words, please confirm that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution. This is enforced on Pull Requests and requires `Signed-off-by` with the email address for the author in the commit message.

The DCO is a representation by someone stating they have the right to contribute the code they have proposed for acceptance into a project: [https://developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org)

That representation is important for legal purposes and was the community-developed outcome after a $1 billion [lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes) by SCO against IBM. The representation is designed to prevent issues but also keep the burden on contributors low. It has proven very adaptable to other projects, is built into git itself (and now also GitHub), and is in use by thousands of projects to avoid more burdensome requirements to contribute (such as a CLA).

### DCO and Real Names

The DCO requires the use of a real name that can be used to identify someone in case there is an issue about a contribution they made. 

**A real name does not require a legal name, nor a birth name, nor any name that appears on an official ID (e.g. a passport). Your real name is the name you convey to people in the community for them to use to identify you as you. The key concern is that your identification is sufficient enough to contact you if an issue were to arise in the future about your contribution.**

Your real name should not be an anonymous id or false name that misrepresents who you are.

## Committing

Please write a commit message with Fixes Issue # if there is an outstanding issue that is fixed. It’s okay to submit a PR without a corresponding issue; just please try to be detailed in the description of the problem you’re addressing.
